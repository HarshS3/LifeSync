## graphify

This project has a graphify knowledge graph at graphify-out/.

Rules:
- Before answering architecture or codebase questions, read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md for god nodes and community structure
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, navigate it instead of reading raw files
- For cross-module "how does X relate to Y" questions, prefer `graphify query "<question>"`, `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"`, or `graphify explain "<concept>"` over grep — these traverse the graph's EXTRACTED + INFERRED edges instead of scanning files
- After modifying code files in this session, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost)

## Code Search

Use `semble search` to find code by describing what it does or naming a symbol/identifier, instead of grep:

​```bash
semble search "authentication flow" ./my-project
semble search "save_pretrained" ./my-project
semble search "save model to disk" ./my-project --top-k 10
​```

If you anticipate doing more than one search, use `semble index` to create an index.

​```bash
semble index ./my-project -o my_index
​```

You can then reuse this index later on:

​```bash
semble search "save_pretrained" --index my_index
​```

An index is not automatically updated, so if the code changes significantly, reindex. If you notice stale results while resolving searches to files, reindex.

Use `--content docs` to search documentation and prose, `--content config` for config files (yaml, toml, etc.), or `--content all` to search code, docs, and config:

​```bash
semble search "deployment guide" ./my-project --content docs
semble search "database host port" ./my-project --content config
semble search "authentication" ./my-project --content all
​```

Use `semble find-related` to discover code similar to a known location (pass `file_path` and `line` from a prior search result):

​```bash
semble find-related src/auth.py 42 ./my-project
​```

Like search, `find-related` also accepts an `--index` argument.

`path` defaults to the current directory when omitted; git URLs are accepted.

If `semble` is not on `$PATH`, use `uvx --from "semble[mcp]" semble` in its place.

### Workflow

1. Index the repo using `semble index -o cached_index`.
2. Start with `semble search` to find relevant chunks. Pass the index to achieve results faster.
3. Use `--content docs` for documentation, `--content config` for config files, or `--content all` for everything.
4. Inspect full files only when the returned chunk does not give enough context.
5. Optionally use `semble find-related` with a promising result's `file_path` and `line` to discover related implementations.
6. Use grep only when you need exhaustive literal matches or quick confirmation of an exact string.
